iodfengine is a defrag-oriented engine, a fork of ioquake3 with some dfengine features and some new things.

ioq3 - http://ioquake3.org/
dfengine - http://cggdev.org/

What comes from dfengine:
con_filter[0-9]
/download
/cl_mapAutoDownload
Drakkar's fast loading code
And some minor things.

What's new:
scr_hud_snap_draw 1 - snapping hud, shows zones of possible acceleration (for 8 ms frametime)
scr_hud_snap_auto - auto-shifting angle of the hud for different strafe styles, scr_hud_snap_def - offset with no keys pressed or with scr_hud_snap_auto 0
scr_hud_snap_speed - calculate zones for the stated speed instead

scr_hud_pitch - angle marks, setting it to "-15 70" for example will put two marks at -15 and 70 degrees of pitch 

Clock :)
con_timestamp [0-1]
con_timedisplay [0-3]

Made toggleable:
con_drawversion [0-1]
con_filter [0-1]
con_completemapnames [0-1]
